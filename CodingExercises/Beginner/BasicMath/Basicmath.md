### Basic Math Operations â€“ Write a function to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.
This is a beginner problem,so first i will simply focus on writing functions and passing harcoded values to them and print the result<br>

The implmentation of this will be in **src/basic/bin/main.rs**

However a more advanced version(from language perspective) is this version:
1. Read the values from the user
2. Try to parse them to numbers
3. Do the arithmetic operation and print the result<br>

The implementation of this will be in **src/advanced/bin/main.rs**
