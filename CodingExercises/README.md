## Coding exercies for Rust
This folder will have coding exercies for beginner, intermediate and advanced categories generated by ChatGPT

### Beginner (Fundamentals)
1. Hello, World! – Print "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. Basic Math Operations – Write a function to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.
3. Control Flow – Implement an if-else check to determine if a number is even or odd.
4. Loops & Iterators – Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers using a for loop.
5. Ownership & Borrowing – Demonstrate moving and borrowing a string.

### Intermediate (Structs, Enums, and Traits)
1. Custom Structs – Define a Rectangle struct with a method to calculate its area.
2. Enums & Pattern Matching – Create an enum representing different types of weather and use match to display messages.
3. Error Handling – Implement a function that reads from a file and properly handles errors.
4. Lifetimes – Write a function that returns the longest string slice from two inputs.
5. Concurrency – Use threads to increment a counter safely with Arc<Mutex<T\>>.

### Advanced (Memory Management, Macros, Async)
1. Smart Pointers – Implement a simple reference-counted linked list with Rc<RefCell<T>>.
2. Macros – Write a custom macro that prints messages with a timestamp.
3. Networking – Build a simple TCP server and client using std::net.
4. Asynchronous Programming – Fetch data from a URL using reqwest with tokio.
5. FFI (Foreign Function Interface) – Call a C function from Rust using extern "C".
